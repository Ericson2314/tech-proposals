# Haskell Foundation Project Template - place your title here

This template is for Haskell Foundation Technical Proposals that are projects to be executed by the Haskell Foundation, without necessarily
having any further involvement by the proposer.


## Abstract

This section should provide a summary of the proposal that identifies the key problems to be solved and summarizes the solution.

## Background

This section should explain any background (targeting a casual audience) needed to understand the proposalâ€™s motivation (e.g. a high level overview of the technical details and some history).

## Problem Statement

This section should describe the problem that the proposal intends to solve and how solving the problem will benefit the Haskell community.
It should also enumerate the requirements against which a solution should be evaluated.

## Prior Art and Related Efforts

This section should describe prior attempts to solve the problem, other relevant prior work, and what others in the community are doing to address the problem.
It should describe the relationship between the proposed work and the existing efforts.
If past attempts did not succeed, this section should provide a theory of why not.

## Technical Content

This section should describe the work that is being proposed to the community for comment, including both technical aspects (choices of system architecture, integration with existing tools and workflows) and community governance (how the developed project will be administered, maintained, and otherwise cared for in the future).
It should also describe the benefits, drawbacks, and risks that are associated with these decisions.
It can be a good idea to describe alternative approaches here as well, and why the proposer prefers the current approach.

## Timeline

Are there any deadlines that the HF needs to be aware of?

## Budget

How much money is needed to accomplish the goal?
How will it be used?

## Stakeholders

Who stands to gain or lose from the implementation of this proposal?
Proposals should identify stakeholders so that they can be contacted for input, and a final decision should not occur without having made a good-faith effort to solicit representative feedback from important stakeholder groups.

## Success

Under what conditions will the project be considered a success?
