# Haskell Foundation Tech Track

---

The Haskell Foundation Technical Track (HFTT) is a task force of the Haskell Foundation.

## Purpose

The HF Technical Track is an experienced group of people with knowledge of the Haskell ecosystem, responsible for the strategic technical direction on behalf of the Haskell Foundation. HFTT members should be either individuals responsible for a specific part of the Haskell ecosystem, or contributors and committers to parts of it.


## Responsibilities

HFTT Members are tasked with the following responsibilities:

- Communicate with the community regarding technical the Haskell Foundation Technical Proposal (HFTP) process goings-on
- Attend monthly HFTP meetings, weighing in pros and cons of every HFTP
- Accept, postpone or reject each HFTP
- Report regarding the status of assigned HFTPs when designated a shepherd
- Hold elections as member terms expire

## Delegated powers

None.

The HFTT may make decisions regarding accepted technical projects. The CTO (or other delegated HF executive) shall arrange budgetary or resource requests as needed, based on the outcome of decisions made by the HFTT, with the budget committee and Executive Director of the HF.


## Term

The participation of least one HF executive is required and indefinite. General HFTT members serve for 3 years.

## Membership

HF Executive:

- Emily Pillmore ([@emilypi](https://github.com/emilypi))

Members:

- Chris Smith ([@cdsmith](https://github.com/cdsmith))
- Davean Scies ([@snoyberg](https://github.com/davean))
- Gershom Bazerman ([@Bodigrim](https://github.com/gbaz))
- John Ericson ([@davean](https://github.com/Ericson2314))
- Andrew Lelechenko ([@ekmett](https://github.com/Bodigrim))
- HÃ©cate ([@Kleidukos](https://github.com/Kleidukos))
- Koz Ross ([@KozRoss](https://github.com/kozross))
- Evie Ciobanu ([@eviefp](https://github.com/eviefp))
- Joachim Breitner ([@nomeata](https://github.com/nomeata/))

## Membership Rules

- Reporting must be accurate, consistent, and in good faith
- Changes to HFTT membership require simple majority approval
- 1 HF Executive and 8 general members shall be required for a functioning HFTT
- No one may serve two terms consecutively, except for the HF Executive.
- Elections *must* be held such that there is no period when the HFTT is not at full membership

## Election Procedure

Elections shall be held in a public manner, using the forum designated by the HF bylaws for formal discussion. The delegating HF Executive shall approve all language for the election publication. All additional publication on the part of the HFTT for the purpose of socializing the election should link to the formal discussion. Elections should be announced publicly exactly 60 days before member terms expire, and submissions should cease to be accepted 14 days before member terms expire, with all membership decisions finalized and publicized 7 days before member terms expire. During this 7-day lame duck period, no votes may be made on proposals.

If not enough candidates apply for the number of seats expiring, the delegating HF Executive may fill these seats as needed using their discretion.

## Becoming a member

It is not required to be a part of the HFTT in order to work on projects. In fact, it's quite the opposite: in order to find a list of projects on which to volunteer, one need only send a message (e.g. an email, slack DM, etc) to the leaders of individual projects. Likewise, individuals may freely contribute ideas and analysis of technical proposals by taking part in the HF Tech Proposal (HFTP) process commentary. However, the HFTT exists as the body empowered to ratify proposals and supervise projects to completion.

In order to become a member, one must apply at election time, and be elected to the HFTT. With the exception of the first iteration of the HFTT, all members are elected by means of the election process.


## Voting Procedure

Ranked voting is used, with the following criteria required for each status:

### HFTP Statuses

- Acceptance: 66% majority
- Dormant: Simple majority
- Postponed: Simple majority
- Revision needed: Simple majority
- Rejected: 66% majority

### Membership changes

Membership changes require 66% majority for approval. All initial membership seats shall be appointed by the delegating HF Executive at their discretion.


## Reporting

HFTT members are expected to join monthly HFTP review meetings. If shepherding, project statuses should be reported at the bi-monthly HFTT standups.


## Documents

The HFTT stores its working documents and deliverables in the public "Technical Agenda Task Force" folder in the Haskell
Foundation Google Drive folder (see: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1aGuAbF-quAGqGYqlOEUXnPiFb-KarAa6). Additionall, all HFTP documents, including proposals, templates, charter, and proposal specification documents live in https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/.


## HFTT Bylaws

Any change to this charter requires a 66% majority vote from the HFTT, with two exceptions:

* The HFTT may change its method of document storage at will.
* The HFTT may make changes to its membership according to the rules set
  out in the *Membership Rules* section above.
