# Haskell Foundation Tech Track

---

The Haskell Foundation Technical Track (HFTT) is a task force of the Haskell Foundation.

## Purpose

The HF Technical Track is an experienced group of people with knowledge of the Haskell ecosystem, responsible for the strategic technical direction on behalf of the Haskell Foundation. HFTT members should be either individuals responsible for a specific part of the Haskell ecosystem, or contributors and committers to parts of it. The members are selected by the HF CTO based on their expertise and reputation in the community. 


## Responsibilities

HFTT Members are tasked with the following responsibilities:

- communicating with the community regarding technical the Haskell Foundation Technical Proposal (HFTP) process goings-on
- Attend monthly HFTP meetings, weighing in pros and cons of every HFTP
- accepting, postponing or rejecting each HFTP
- Shepherding and reporting regarding the status of their assigned HFTPs.
- Hold elections as members' terms expire

## Delegated powers

None.

The HFTT may make decisions regarding accepted technical projects. The CTO shall arrange budgetary or resource requests as needed, based on the outcome of decisions made by the HFTT, with the budget committee and Executive Director of the HF.


## Term

CTO participation is required and indefinite. General HFTT members serve for 2 years. 

## Membership

## Membership Rules

- Reporting must be accurate, consistent, and in good faith
- Changes to HFTT membership require simple majority approval
- 1 CTO and 8 general members shall be required for a functioning HFTT 
- No one may serve two terms consecutively, except for the CTO.
- Elections *must* be held such that there is no period when the HFTT is not at full membership

## Election Procedure 

Elections shall be held in a public manner, using the forum designated by the HF bylaws for formal discussion. The CTO shall approve all language for the election publication. All additional publication on the part of the HFTT for the purpose of socializing the election should link to the formal discussion. Elections should be announced publicly exactly 60 days before member terms expire, and submissions should cease to be accepted 14 days before member terms expire, with all membership decisions finalized and publicized 7 days before member terms expire. During this 7-day lame duck period, no votes may be made on proposals. 

If not enough candidates apply for the number of seats expiring, the CTO may fill these seats as needed using their discretion.


## Voting Procedure

Voting is only required for two procedures. 

### HFTP Statuses

- Accepance: 66% majority
- Dormant: Simple majority
- Postponed: Simple majority
- Revision needed: Simple majority

If none of these applies, the proposal is Rejected.

### Membership changes

Requires 66% majority for approval. All initial membership seats shall be appointed by the CTO at their discretion. 


## Reporting

HFTT members are expected to join monthly HFTP review meetings. If shepherding, project statuses should be reported at the bi-monthly HFTT standups. 


## Documents

The HFTT stores its working documents and deliverables in the public "Technical Agenda Task Force" folder in the Haskell
Foundation Google Drive folder (see: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1aGuAbF-quAGqGYqlOEUXnPiFb-KarAa6). Additionall, all HFTP documents, including proposals, templates, charter, and proposal specification documents live in https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/.


## HFTT Bylaws

Any change to this charter requires a 66% majority vote from the HFTT, with two exceptions:

* The HFTT may change its method of document storage, but not repository.
* The HFTT may make changes to its membership according to the rules set
out in the *Membership Rules* section above.
